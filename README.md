 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Controls,Machine learning and RTOS.
 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source safety critical and intelligent embedded systems projects.
 ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with realtime-embedded system development.
 ðŸ’¬ Ask me about debugging and best embedded systems resources
